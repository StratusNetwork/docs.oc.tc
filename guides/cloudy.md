Stratus has its own build server called **Cloudy**. Cloudy makes building maps with others or by yourself simple and easy! To get started, connect to the server using the address `mapdev.stratus.network`. The following guide will explain how to create a world, choose the world settings, and how to add people to your world.

# 1. Main Menu

When you first spawn in the Cloudy lobby, you spawn with a book in your inventory. The book will give you access to the **Main Menu** which allows easy access and creations of worlds. To access the main menu, **right click** the book. 
 
The main menu has 3 main sections:
 
- The player skull: Clicking this will take you to a world creation page.
- The compass: After creating your world you can use this sub-menu to change world settings .
- The book and quill: Clicking this item will allow you to customize individual preferences, however this will not be covered in this guide.

# 2. Creating a World

Creating a world is simple, open the main menu and click on the player skull. It will take you to a page that looks like this:

Clicking on the **green clay block** will teleport you to your world. Now, you can begin building!
 
If you want to teleport to someone else's world, you can use the command `/tp [playername]` or `/world tp [world name]`. To return to your world, you simply need to reopen the main menu, click on the player skull, and finally click on the **green clay block**.

Please note that you only get one world to build in, if you want more worlds you need to [buy a rank to unlock them](https://stratusnetwork.buycraft.net/).

# 3. Changing your World Settings

Once you create your world, you might want to change some settings. With Cloudy you can toggle rain, day cycles, explosions, fire spread and more using **flags**! To do so, teleport to your world, open the main menu and click on the compass. You will see a page that looks like this:

This submenu lets you add builders, change world settings, and download the map.

- Pickaxe: Clicking on this will take you to another menu that allows you to add builders.
- Banner: Clicking on this will take you to another menu that allows you to change settings.
- Minecart: Clicking on this will let you download your world.
 
To change world settings click on the banner, it will take you to a page like this:

Each item is a setting and hovering over them will tell you which setting it is. Clicking on a item will disable/enable the setting. For example, clicking on the clock will disable the daylight cycle and clicking on it again will enable it. Another important example is the lime wool block, clicking on it will enable players to teleport to your world, so if you want help or feedback from others make sure that it is **enabled**.
 
Hopefully this guide helps simplify Cloudy, and makes mapmaking easier for you, good luck with your mapmaking!
